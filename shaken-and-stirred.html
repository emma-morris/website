      <h2>Problem statement</h2>

      <p>The population of dogs in the UK was estimated at 12.5 million in 2020/21 and, since the start of the pandemic, a total of 3.2 million households in the UK have acquired a pet. For many workers, the cosy days of remote working are coming
        to an end and some may find that their new acquisition is more trouble to look after than they had anticipated and longer days away from home is not fair for the animal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-solution-text">
      <h2>Solution</h2>

      <p>The aim is to create an on-demand dog walking and pet sitting service that will consist of simple ways for pet owners to search for a suitable dog walker/pet carer, book walks/sitters, manage payments and track dog walks. Professional dog
        walkers/carers will also be able to use the app to organise their client base, manage payments and plan walking routes.</p>

      <h2>Retrospective</h2>

      <h3>How did you interpret the project brief?</h3>
      <p>The project brief was to design a location-based responsive web application. As my own version of this, I chose to design a dog walking and pet care app that helps pet owners find pet walkers/carers near them and their searched location.
      </p>

      <h3>How have you met the project objective?</h3>
      <p>I have met the project objective by creating a web-responsive web application that meets the needs of its users and solves the problems they are facing with existing apps. I have created an app that allows pet owners to search for suitable
        dog walkers/pet carers, book walks/sitters, manage payments and track dog walks.</p>

      <h3>What roadblocks did you encounter as you worked on each deliverable? How did you overcome these roadblocks?</h3>
      <p>One of the biggest roadblocks for this project was time management. I spent a lot of time trying to really fine tune my low fidelity wire-frames when I should have realised that my designs were most likely going to change and adapt
        throughout the project and conversations with my mentor. I started this project thinking I could create two sides to this app. From the pet owner perspective and also the dog walking/pet carer perspective. From a few tasks in, I just knew
        that with the time I had, this wasn’t going to be possible. To overcome this, I focussed on my MVP and created the screens that were most needed in order for the app to work.</p>

      <h3>If you could, what would you do differently?</h3>
      <p>I think I could have benefited from doing more user testing & research throughout. I found the user interviews and preference testing tasks to be very useful so this is something that I think I will do more of during future projects.
        Another thing that could have helped me decide on my layouts quicker was doing some more rapid sketching, this was a useful exercise and helped to visually see what would work and what wouldn’t before creating them digitally.</p>
